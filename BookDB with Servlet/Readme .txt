- BookForm.java
	- Click src -> java -> servlet -> BookForm.java
	- Connected on my machine to jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/BookDB
	- This file is a web app that lets user input a isbn and returns the author, title, and pages

- Book.sql
	
	- Creates many to many relationship author-book-writtenBy tables


The BookaApp has the nbproject/private & root/dist items removed from it folders. My Laptop was having issues with running those files after the deletion of those items so I did the following:

1) Build the Applications click Update on the pop up message
2) Run as normal
